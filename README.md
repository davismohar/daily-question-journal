Simple App hosted on Vercel/Heroku that has a question for every date. Built just for fun to play with some technologies I wanted to try out.

- F# backend with the Falco framework
- Vue frontend
- Auth0 for authentication
- Heroku hosting the backend and postgres instance
- Vercel hosting for the frontend
